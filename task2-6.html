        <div id="content2">
        <h1 class="task2-2">Check out my borders</h1>
        <p class="task2-2">We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>
            Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red border</span>.</p>
            <hr>
            You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
            <br>
            all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span>
            <br>
            That prevents it from messing with the line height.
        </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <br>
            Notice how the borders double up here:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="red-border">This line has a red border</div>
            <div class="blue-border">This line has a blue border</div>
            <br>
            <br>
            Notice how this fixes the borders:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="red-border2">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
            <div id="blue-border2">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
        </div>
    </body>
